You need to have Python 3 installed on your computer and be able to install Python libraries through the Python package manager, pip. 
Install some third party libraries for Python. These are:
Flask, which I used to route web traffic through HTTP requests to specific functions in our code base,
SQLAlchemy, which I used to make the interaction between Python and our database smoother,
Flask-SQLAlchemy, which I used to make the interaction between Flask and SQLAlchemy smoother.
pip3 install --user flask sqlalchemy flask-sqlalchemy
